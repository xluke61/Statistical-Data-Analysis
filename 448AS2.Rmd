Explaination:
The regression output provides insights into how well our model explains the variations in the "actual sales price" (V104) using other variables, excluding the "actual construction costs" (V105).

From the Residuals section, we see that the differences between the observed and predicted sales prices range from a decrease of 901.15 to an increase of 645.31, with a median difference close to zero (-1.50). This suggests that our model's predictions are generally close to the actual values, with some exceptions.

The Coefficients table gives us the relationship between each variable and the sales price. For instance, for every one-unit increase in the COMPLETION YEAR, the sales price increases by approximately 152.1 units. Variables marked with stars (like COMPLETION YEAR and COMPLETION QUARTER) are particularly significant in predicting the sales price. However, some variables are marked as NA, indicating potential issues like multicollinearity.

Our model's overall fit is good. The Multiple R-squared value of 0.9879 suggests that our model explains about 98.79% of the variability in the sales price. The Adjusted R-squared further refines this to 98.48%, accounting for the number of predictors used.

Lastly, the F-statistic is 321.9 with a very low p-value, indicating that our model is statistically significant and does a much better job of predicting sales price than a model with no predictors.

In conclusion, this output tells us that our model is robust and does an excellent job of explaining the variations in the sales price using the given variables.

library(MASS)

# Assuming the data is loaded as 'Residen'
# Fit a linear regression model using backwards selection without displaying verbose output
backward_model <- suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(step(lm(V104 ~ . - V105, data = Residen), direction = 'backward', trace = 0)))

# Fit a linear regression model using stepwise selection
stepwise_model <- step(lm(V104 ~ 1, data = Residen), scope = list(lower = ~1, upper = ~. - V105), direction = 'both')

# Compare the models

backward_summary <- summary(backward_model)
stepwise_summary <- summary(stepwise_model)

# Computational Time (For simplicity, we'll use system.time() for a rough estimate)
backward_time <- system.time(suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(step(lm(V104 ~ . - V105, data = Residen), direction = 'backward', trace = 0))))
stepwise_time <- system.time(step(lm(V104 ~ 1, data = Residen), scope = list(lower = ~1, upper = ~. - V105), direction = 'both'))

# Return the summaries and computational times for review
list(backward_summary = backward_summary, stepwise_summary = stepwise_summary, backward_time = backward_time, stepwise_time = stepwise_time)
```

Backward Selection Model:
Uses 19 predictors and explains a significant portion of the variance with an R-squared of 0.9869.
Took about 10.727 seconds to compute.

Stepwise Selection Model:
Only includes the intercept, suggesting no predictors were significant.
Computed almost instantly at 0.002 seconds.

Summary:
The backward model is more complex and fits the data well but took longer to compute. In contrast, the stepwise model is simplistic and quick but might not capture the data's nuances. The choice depends on the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

```{r}
library(glmnet)

# Prepare the data
X <- as.matrix(Residen[, -c(104, 105)])  # Excluding V104 and V105 for predictors
y <- Residen$V104

# LASSO Regression
lasso_model <- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1)
best_lambda_lasso <- lasso_model$lambda.min
lasso_coefficients <- coef(lasso_model, s = best_lambda_lasso)

# Ridge Regression
ridge_model <- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 0)
best_lambda_ridge <- ridge_model$lambda.min
ridge_coefficients <- coef(ridge_model, s = best_lambda_ridge)

# Return the coefficients for review
list(lasso_coefficients = lasso_coefficients, ridge_coefficients = ridge_coefficients)
```

LASSO Regression Coefficients:
Intercept: 40.4444
V104: 0.9708
All other predictors have coefficients of 0, indicating they've been excluded from the model.

Ridge Regression Coefficients:
Intercept: -374.3924
START YEAR: 0.4609
COMPLETION YEAR: 1.3689
V104: 0.4643
... (and so on for all other predictors)

Comparison:
LASSO has selected only the intercept and V104 as significant predictors.
Ridge regression has included all the predictors with varying coefficients.
In conclusion, LASSO provides a sparser model with fewer significant predictors, while Ridge includes all predictors with adjusted coefficients.

```{r}
# Set the RNG seed
set.seed(12345)

# Read the data
data <- read.csv("parkinsons.csv", header = TRUE)

# The outcome of interest is UPDRS
y <- data$UPDRS

# Drop the UPDRS column to get the model matrix X
X <- data[,-ncol(data)]

# Split the data
train_index <- sample(1:nrow(data), 30)
train_data <- data[train_index,]
test_data <- data[-train_index,]

# Splitting the model matrix and outcome
X_train <- train_data[,-ncol(train_data)]
y_train <- train_data$UPDRS

X_test <- test_data[,-ncol(test_data)]
y_test <- test_data$UPDRS

# Standardize the training and test sets
X_train <- scale(X_train)
X_test <- scale(X_test)

# Fit the linear model
model <- lm(y_train ~ X_train)

# Check the residuals
residuals <- resid(model)

# Check if the model fits the training data exactly by examining the residuals
all(residuals == 0)


```
Why is this model not going to be useful?  
The linear model might fit the training data exactly, especially if the number of predictors (features) is close to or greater than the number of observations. This leads to overfitting, while the model may fit the training data very well, it often performs poorly on unseen data.

```

X97 seems to be the most predictive feature for UPDRS among all other features considered. The model assigns a non-zero coefficient to this feature, indicating its importance.  
The LASSO regression has simplified the model dramatically by reducing the number of features to just one, making it much easier to interpret.  
By using LASSO, we are also reducing the risk of overfitting, as it incorporates a penalty term that constrains the size of the coefficients. The absence of other features in the model suggests that adding more features won't likely improve the model's performance.  
Since only one feature is selected, it can be assumed that this model will generalize well to new data, provided that the feature X97 is a strong and reliable predictor for UPDRS.

y_train_matrix_new <- as.matrix(y_train_new)
X_test_matrix_new <- as.matrix(X_test_new)

# Use LASSO regression with cross-validation on the new split
cv.lasso_new <- cv.glmnet(X_train_matrix_new, y_train_matrix_new, alpha = 1, nfolds = 30, 
                          lambda = 10^seq(3, -1, length=100), thresh = 1e-10)

# Optimal value of lambda for the new split
lambda_optimal_new <- cv.lasso_new$lambda.min
print(paste("Optimal value of Î» for the new split:", lambda_optimal_new))

# Fit the LASSO model with the optimal lambda for the new split
lasso.model_new <- glmnet(X_train_matrix_new, y_train_matrix_new, alpha = 1, lambda = lambda_optimal_new)

# Extract the coefficients for the new split
coefficients_new <- coef(lasso.model_new)

# Print the coefficients for the new split
print(coefficients_new)

# Number of selected features (excluding intercept and features with coefficient equal to zero) for the new split
num_features_selected_new <- sum(coefficients_new != 0) - 1
print(paste("Number of features selected in the new split:", num_features_selected_new))



```

No, the same features have not been selected in the final model after the different random split. In the original split, only feature X97 was selected. In contrast, the new split selected six features: X9, X56, X83, X86, X94, and X97. This discrepancy suggests that the model's feature selection is sensitive to how the data is split into training and test sets, which may indicate a degree of instability or overfitting.

mse_1se <- mean((predictions_1se - y_test)^2)

rmse_1se <- sqrt(mse_1se)

# Number of predictors in each model
num_pred_min <- sum(coef(cv.elasticnet, s=cv.elasticnet$lambda.min) != 0)
num_pred_1se <- sum(coef(cv.elasticnet, s=cv.elasticnet$lambda.1se) != 0)

# Print results

cat("RMSE lambda.1se:", rmse_1se, "\n")
cat("Number of predictors lambda.1se:", num_pred_1se, "\n")

# Plot cross-validation results
plot(cv.elasticnet)








```
I would choose the model with lambda.min because it has a lower RMSE and MSE. This indicates that, on average, the predictions from the lambda.min model are closer to the true values.
