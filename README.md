This project centers on data analysis and model building, utilizing the R language and related statistical methods to address real-world problems. The project is divided into three parts:

Analysis of Residential Building Dataset:

Explore the correlation between variables and visualize using graphical tools.
Establish a linear regression model to explain the "actual sales price" (excluding the variable "actual construction costs") and interpret the model summary output.
Fit linear regression models using backward selection and stepwise selection methods, comparing these two approaches.
Fit models using Ridge regression and LASSO regression, determining the appropriate λ value through cross-validation and comparing these models.
Analysis of Parkinson's Disease Patient Dataset:

Read and set up the model matrix, then randomly split the data into a training set and a test set.
Standardize the training and test sets, fit the training data using the LASSO method, and find the tuning parameter λ through leave-one-out cross-validation.
Determine the final model and discuss the features and conclusions of model selection.
Repeat the analysis with a different random split, comparing whether the same features are selected in the final model.
Analysis of US Health Insurance Dataset:

Predict insurance charges using the ElasticNet model and optimize alpha and lambda values through 10-fold cross-validation.
Make predictions on the test set, report the MSE or RMSE of both models, and the number of predictors used.
Plot the cross-validation result chart and choose the model based on the analysis results.
Overall, this project requires proficiency in using the R language for data processing, visualization, building, and comparing different statistical models, as well as optimizing model parameters through methods like cross-validation. These skills are crucial for data analysis and statistical modeling.
